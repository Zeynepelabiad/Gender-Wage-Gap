# Exploratory Data Analysis of Gender Wage Gap

While women's participation in the labor force has significantly increased in the last century, a sign of progress on the gender inequality front, much must be done to address the gender wage gap. This is a very important topic for me as a woman and, more importantly, for the global community. The United Nations estimates that closing the gender wage gap could increase global GDP by 35% on average.   Closing this gap could go a long way to decreasing global poverty. Few measures can have that type of impact, which is why addressing this gap is essential to the achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this project, I will examine and find important correlations between the gender gap and other factors such as the Gender Development Index and Human Development Index. These visualizations are important as they enlighten people, politicians, and decision-makers to take corrective actions. The more we can do to address the wage gap, the more we can grow and prosper as a society together.
